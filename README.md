# Predicting-Survival-In-The-Titanic-Dataset

* This application will be built with Python using the Flask framework and will include a machine learning model that will train to detect Whether a passenger survived on Titanic ship or not.

* Do ‚≠ê the repository , if it helped you in anyway.

# Data set :

We will be using a decision tree to make predictions about the Titanic data set from Kaggle. This data set provides information on the Titanic passengers and can be used to predict whether a passenger survived or not.

# Libraries Used :

* flask is for creating the application server and pages.
* matplotlib, seaborn are for data visualization
* numpy is for arrays computation and mathematical operations.
* pandas is for manipulating and wrangling structured data.
* scikit-learn is a machine learning toolkit
* pickle is for saving model

# Algorithms Used :

* Decision_Tree_Classifier 
* GridSearchCV
